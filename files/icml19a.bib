  abstract = 	 {Model fusion is a fundamental problem in collec-tive machine learning (ML) where independentexperts with heterogeneous learning architecturesare required to combine expertise to improve pre-dictive performance. This is particularly chal-lenging in information-sensitive domains whereexperts do not have access to each otherâ€™s internalarchitecture and local data. This paper presentsthe first collective model fusion framework formultiple experts with heterogeneous black-box ar-chitectures. The proposed method will enable thisby addressing the key issues of how black-boxexperts interact to understand the predictive be-haviors of one another; how these understandingscan be represented and shared efficiently amongthemselves; and how the shared understandingscan be combined to generate high-quality consen-sus prediction. The performance of the resultingframework is analyzed theoretically and demon-strated empirically on several datasets.}
