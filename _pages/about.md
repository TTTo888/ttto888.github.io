I am currently a Senior Research Scientist at AWS AI Labs, Amazon in Palo Alto, CA. 

Prior to my appointment at Amazon, I worked at the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, IBM Research in Cambridge, MA (2018-2020) as a Research Staff Member. 

Before IBM, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS), MIT (2017-2018). 

Prior to MIT, I was a Research Fellow at National University of Singapore (2015-2017) where I earned my PhD degree in Machine Learning (2010-2015). 

My PhD adviser is Associate Professor Kian Hsiang Low.
