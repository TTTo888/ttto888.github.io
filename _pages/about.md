I am a Senior Research Scientist at AWS AI Labs, Amazon in Palo Alto, CA. Prior to my appointment at Amazon, I worked at the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, IBM Research in Cambridge (2018-2020). Before IBM, I was a postdoc at the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS), MIT during 2017-2018 and before that, I was a research fellow at National University of Singapore where I earned my PhD degree in Machine Learning. My advisor is Associate Professor Kian Hsiang Low.
