During my early years as a PhD student and then as a postdoc in NUS, I had been working mostly on developing cost-effective Gaussian process models for big data with a particular focus on distributed and anytime algorithms that can either leverage the multi-core architecture to parallelize the processing effectively or cope with the budgeted resource to trade-off gracefully between prediction quality and processing cost. For more information, refer to my prior publications at ICML-15, ICML-16 and AAAI-17.
