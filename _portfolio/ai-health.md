I am interested in application of ML to healthcare. Two important desiderata of ML models for healthcare applications are (1) transferability where knowledge learned from one domain can be transferred effectively to another and (2) interpretability via data prototyping where models whose predictions at prototypical data points are interpretable. Relevant papers were recently published in IJCAI-19, AAAI-20, WWW-21.

Research Highlight:

I and my collaborators, Douglas A. Lauffenburger (MIT) and Sara Magliacane (University of Amsterdam), were awarded an exploratory research grant (150K USD) for Cross-Species Translation of COVID-19 Systems Serology Data for Infection and Vaccine Treatment by the MIT-IBM board of directors (12/2020-12/2021)

My recent work on discovering explainable representation for Drug-Drug Interaction in collaboration with colleagues from Harvard, Georgia Tech and IQVIA was mentioned on MIT Tech Review and Tech Republic:
